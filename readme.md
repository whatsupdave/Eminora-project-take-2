DISCLAIMER

//
This is my first project working indivually.
If you see this message, this webpage is still not responsive and will be until this message disappears. 
I know, it's my big mistake, that I started it from doing webpage for laptop first, not mobile.
The reason why I haven't started from mobile, because I had no design ideas or references from the client, so it's easier for me to start implementing ideas on laptop version first.

This is a project for accounting related services.

I did not have any references for the webpage from the client, so design and everything is my idea, which is a challenge by itself.

I'm using Bootstrap, together with Sass (main.css and main.scss) for costumizing it and also my very own costume CSS (main-withoutSass.css).
