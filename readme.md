This is a future real-life project for accounting related services.

I did not have any references for the webpage from the client, so design and everything is my idea, which is a challenge by itself.

I'm using Bootstrap, together with Sass (main.css and main.scss) for costumizing it and also my very own costume CSS (main-withoutSass.css).
